# Hello World ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡´


As a Data Scientist at SMJ, I consult on projects across various sectors, including Energy, Aquaculture, Water, and Large Language Models (LLMs), among others.

I am currently pursuing a MSc in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Denmark, with my thesis focused on the application of AI in Urban Drainage Systems.
